## Instructions 

- why do I maintain this repository?
Since it's hard for me to find a complete and feasible algorithms set on ‘Reinforcement Learning’ which is of vital help for freshers who want to get into this field. 
Nowthat I have made a detailed reading notes on the excellent book "A-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning" and implemented most of its algorithms, why not share them to public? 
I believe the quote 'talk is cheap, show me the code'.
- what are in this repository?
- How to utilize them for your projects?
