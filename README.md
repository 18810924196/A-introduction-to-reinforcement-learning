# A-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning

## Instructions 

### - why do I maintain this repository?
Since it's hard for me to find a complete and feasible algorithms set on ‘Reinforcement Learning’ which is of vital help for freshers who want to get into this field.  

Nowthat I have made a detailed reading notes on the excellent book "A-introduction-to-reinforcement-learning" and implemented most of its algorithms, why not share them to public?   

I believe the quote > 'talk is cheap, show me the code'.  

### - what are in this repository?  
This repository consists of the algorithms from first 9 chapters in this book: [Reinforcement Learning:An introduction --2012 version](https://files.cnblogs.com/files/lvlvlvlvlv/SuttonBook.pdf)  

The algorithms after 9th chapter will be added continuously by another version of this book.  

- **chapter4** : algorithms from chapter 4. Including two exercises:  
  1. The Gambler 
  2. Jack's Car Rental
### - How to utilize them for your projects?
